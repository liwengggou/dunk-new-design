**Task:** Push local project to GitHub with remote that already had an initial commit.
**Summary:**
- Initialized local git repo on main and committed all files.
- Added remote origin https://github.com/liwengggou/dunk-new-design.git and attempted push; rejected due to existing remote main.
- Executed Option B (overwrite with backup):
  - Force-pushed local main to origin/main using --force-with-lease.
  - Created remote backup branch backup/pre-overwrite-20250915-232933 pointing to previous origin/main (commit aea6ad6).
- Verified: origin/main now tracks local main; backup branch exists on remote.
**Next Steps:**
- (Optional) After confirming everything is good, delete the backup branch: git push origin --delete backup/pre-overwrite-20250915-232933.
- Set up any branch protections on main if needed.

**Task:** Delete remote backup branch after verifying overwrite.
**Summary:**
- Deleted origin branch backup/pre-overwrite-20250915-232933.
- Verified only main remains on remote and pruned remote-tracking refs.
**Next Steps:**
- Proceed with normal development on main.
- Optionally enable branch protection on main in GitHub settings.

**Task:** Designed 5 hover animation options for CTA buttons.
**Summary:**
- Proposed five hover animation concepts tailored to existing classes (.btn, .btn-primary, .btn-outline, .link-pricing):
  1) Lift + glow + underline wipe
  2) Diagonal shine sweep + micro-scale
  3) Border-to-fill morph (outline fills, primary darkens subtly)
  4) Cursor-centered ripple highlight (JS-enhanced)
  5) Magnetic tilt + parallax shine (JS-enhanced)
- Included motion specs, accessibility, and performance notes for each.
**Next Steps:**
- Await selection and preferred accent color/intensity, then implement consistently across the three buttons with prefers-reduced-motion support and test in the live preview.

**Task:** Switched CTA hover to Option 1 (Lift + Glow + Underline Wipe) and removed Option 4 artifacts.
**Summary:**
- Replaced Option 4 ripple CSS with Option 1 styles in landing_page.css, applied to .btn, .btn-outline, .btn-primary, and .link-pricing.
- Removed Option 4 JS block from index.html to keep bundle clean and avoid unused listeners.
- Preserved prefers-reduced-motion support to avoid motion for sensitive users.
**Next Steps:**
- Visually verify in live preview; fine-tune underline thickness, offset, box-shadow intensity, or timing curves if requested.
- Decide if hero CTA should use a slightly stronger elevation than the others.

**Task:** Removed underline effect from CTA hover.
**Summary:**
- Added a CSS override to disable the ::after underline for .btn and .link-pricing so no underline appears on hover/focus.
- Kept lift and glow behaviors intact; prefers-reduced-motion still respected.
**Next Steps:**
- Confirm final look; optionally adjust lift amount or glow intensity if you want even subtler hover feedback.
